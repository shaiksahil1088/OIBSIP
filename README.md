# Oasis Infobyte — Python Projects Collection

A collection of Python projects completed during my Oasis Infobyte Internship / Training.  
The projects help build familiarity with Python basics — console I/O, GUI, API integration, randomness, and working with user input.  

## Projects Overview

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **BMI Calculator** | A simple application to calculate Body Mass Index based on user’s height and weight, then categorize the result (underweight / healthy / overweight / obese). |
| **Chat App** | A basic chat application — practice in handling user interaction / I/O (or GUI / network/socket, depending on your version). |
| **Random Password Generator** | Generates a strong, random password of user-specified length using a mix of letters (upper & lower), digits and special symbols. |
| **Weather App** | Fetches real-time weather information (temperature, humidity, weather condition etc.) for a user-specified city using a weather API. |

## What I Learned / Skills Gained

- Python fundamentals — variables, control flow, functions, user input.  
- Working with built-in modules (e.g. random, string) for tasks like password generation.  
- Console-based programming (input/output) and possibly GUI (if you used a library like `tkinter`).  
- API integration and JSON parsing — for fetching weather data from a web service.  
- Structuring small, meaningful projects: clear input → processing → output.
